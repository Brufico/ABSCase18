# ABSCase18

This repo contains:

* Everything for the **mandatory** case study *"TitanicCase"*
* A sub-directory for the **optional** extra credit case "ServerDowntime". By doing it, you may earn a 10% bonus on your overall grade. If you don't do it, no penalty. So do it only if you feel like it.

The case study (or both case studies, if you go for the extra credit) report should be printed end given to the procter during the final exam.

Best.
